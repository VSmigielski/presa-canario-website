                                                and why I changed my mind and don't want to sell her anymore:
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="main-14-p">
                                                In the news, I saw that a young woman went for a jog in the morning on the 
                                                beach in California and got killed. Then, the next day I went on the internet 
                                                to look at that story again and found more women who have gotten killed while 
                                                on a jog or morning walk in other states as well. So, I felt obligated to offer 
                                                my help.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="main-14-p">
                                                Andora has unlimited energy and can keep up with any jogger for any distance. She 
                                                is also a very tough protector. On command, anybody can pet her. On another command, 
                                                she will attack and her attack is brutal. If a woman would be jogging with Andora, 
                                                or any other of my trained dogs, she wouldn't get killed but the attacker would get 
                                                killed. However, the price tag of protection dogs like Andora might be too high for 
                                                most people.
                                            </p>

                                                Then, I realized that this dog loves me so much and will already be seven years old, 
                                                so it wouldn't be fair to her to sell her. It would be much better to keep her with me 
                                                in my home, the same environment she has lived in all of her life.

                                    This man was driving all of the way from Alabama, 1,800 miles down, to Arizona to get his puppy. And he said it was worth every penny. He's got a fantastic male puppy and he's never seen such a great dog in his life.
                                    Yes it makes me happy to hear something like that. I am really glad I sold this boy to this good man. We had a good time and my boy will have a good life with him and his family and that's all that matters to me.

                                                and why I changed my mind and don't want to sell her anymore:
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="main-14-p">
                                                In the news, I saw that a young woman went for a jog in the morning on the 
                                                beach in California and got killed. Then, the next day I went on the internet 
                                                to look at that story again and found more women who have gotten killed while 
                                                on a jog or morning walk in other states as well. So, I felt obligated to offer 
                                                my help.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="main-14-p">
                                                Andora has unlimited energy and can keep up with any jogger for any distance. She 
                                                is also a very tough protector. On command, anybody can pet her. On another command, 
                                                she will attack and her attack is brutal. If a woman would be jogging with Andora, 
                                                or any other of my trained dogs, she wouldn't get killed but the attacker would get 
                                                killed. However, the price tag of protection dogs like Andora might be too high for 
                                                most people.

                                                so it wouldn't be fair to her to sell her. It would be much better to keep her with me 
                                                in my home, the same environment she has lived in all of her life.

                                    This man was driving all of the way from Alabama, 1,800 miles down, to Arizona to get his puppy. And he said it was worth every penny. He's got a fantastic male puppy and he's never seen such a great dog in his life.
                                    Yes it makes me happy to hear something like that. I am really glad I sold this boy to this good man. We had a good time and my boy will have a good life with him and his family and that's all that matters to me.
