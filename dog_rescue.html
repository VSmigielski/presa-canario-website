                                    every dog from people who betrayed the trust of their dog, and from people who don’t appreciate the unconditional 
                                    love and loyalty that only a dog can give them. I have a dream that I will open the largest dog rescue facility in

                                    told her that I believe that it could be done; if I would be like Brad Pitt, I would open a dog rescue facility, like 
                                    he did. Because I don’t have Brad Pitt’s money, I can only make this happen if dog lovers throughout the states donate

                                    Today, there are more abandoned dogs wandering the streets than ever before. Now is the time to do something about it.
                                </p>

                                    There was a story recently about a German Shepherd puppy who was found exhausted, close to death, and dehydrated lying in a ditch still 
                                    holding his tennis ball in his mouth. This story took place after Christmas, a time where people purchase a puppy for their kids as a 
                                    Christmas gift. Then, when they find out that they have to take care of a puppy, feed him and clean after him...they just get rid of him 
                                    the easy way. This is the scenario that probably happened to this pup. Somebody drove him far away from home, took him out of the car and 
                                    tossed him his favorite toy. Here boy: “Fetch it!” While the puppy was running after his tennis ball, they jumped into the car and drove 
                                    away. This obedient puppy was running after the car to bring his master his tennis ball...until total exhaustion. Yes, some people are 
                                    cruel like that.
                                </p>
                                <p class="main-p">
                                    I believe that we can help these wonderful animals start a new life with better guardians, but only if we all work on the project together. 
                                    There's strength in numbers. I believe that every dog deserves a happy life.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Now is the time!</strong> Abandoned and unwanted dogs need our help more than ever before. They can’t speak. They can’t look for a new owner by 
                                    themselves. Shelters are constantly full and hundreds of dogs are killed every day. We can help people as well. There will be many people 
                                    needed in order to run a large rescue shelter like this one. We would need to employ a lot of people to work on our “I Have a Dream Dog 
                                    Rescue” project and we will help our economy as well.

                                    <strong>Now is the time!</strong> Because here in Arizona the land is available at amazing low prices and people are willing to work for less than ever 
                                    before. We placed a test ad in the local newspaper and in craigslist to find out if people would be interested in this project. And YES, 
                                    there are many people who are looking for work or even want to volunteer! There are shelters all over the U.S. already, but many people 
                                    who run these rescue shelters are wasting too much money on sending letters to prospective donors and paying themselves high wages.

                                    I already mentioned him in my profile. I found only one picture of Bobby after my parents passed away. I used to have mainly pure bred dogs such as 
                                    German Schnauzer and German Shepherds. But, I rescued several other dogs throughout the years. I remember when I rescued a female Pitbull when I lived 
                                    in California, just in time before they called animal control. The pitbull stayed with my ex-wife for the rest of the pitbull's life. People have been 
                                    afraid of Pitbulls and they still are because of hysterical hate created by TV and other media. But, the media never mentions the other breeds who killed 
                                    people and children because of the stupidity of their owners. The media is now trying to create hate between white police officers and black citizens but 
                                    they never mention how many white people have been killed by black police officers. But, I don't want to create a discussion with this theme here.

                                    I found her in a Phoenix preserve, somebody just dumped her there. It was not easy to catch her because she was aggressive and wild. When I got closer, she 
                                    stood her ground, didn't run away, was just staring and barking aggressively at me. I was impressed; she was so sharp so I gave her the name Sharpie. Then, 
                                    I used an old trick and finally brought her home. She was wild. She didn't know how to play with a tennis ball; she went after my hands not after the ball. 
                                    Then, I taught her a lot of tricks. She was a smart, perfect dog.

                                    I started with Presas because of her. I wanted a dog who would look like her but would be bigger for protection training. So, I went on the Internet and I found 
                                    them: The beautiful Perro de Presa Canario.

                                    Now what happened with Sharpie? When I purchased my first Presas, all my attention went to them and when I looked at Sharpie, I saw that she suffered emotionally. 
                                    She was not the number one dog in our household anymore; I had to split my time between three dogs. She didn't play as much as she used to, she looked sad. Fortunately, 
                                    my neighbors had been looking for a dog. So, I introduced them Sharpie to see if they would like her. They had been impressed with how well-trained she is and how she 
                                    knows all the tricks, even hand signals. They took her home and I could visit her at any time because they lived across the street from me. Sharpie had a new masters 
                                    who loved her, a new family where she was the dog #1 again. I was happy for her. When I came to visit her, she was glad to see me but not interested in me anymore—she 
                                    had a new home.

                            told her that I believe that it could be done; if I would be like Brad Pitt, I would open a dog rescue facility, like 
                            he did. Because I don’t have Brad Pitt’s money, I can only make this happen if dog lovers throughout the states donate

                            Today, there are more abandoned dogs wandering the streets than ever before. Now is the time to do something about it.

                        <p class="main-p">
                            There was a story recently about a German Shepherd puppy who was found exhausted, close to death, and dehydrated lying in a ditch still 
                            holding his tennis ball in his mouth. This story took place after Christmas, a time where people purchase a puppy for their kids as a 
                            Christmas gift. Then, when they find out that they have to take care of a puppy, feed him and clean after him...they just get rid of him 
                            the easy way. This is the scenario that probably happened to this pup. Somebody drove him far away from home, took him out of the car and 
                            tossed him his favorite toy. Here boy: “Fetch it!” While the puppy was running after his tennis ball, they jumped into the car and drove 
                            away. This obedient puppy was running after the car to bring his master his tennis ball...until total exhaustion. Yes, some people are 
                            cruel like that.

                            I believe that we can help these wonderful animals start a new life with better guardians, but only if we all work on the project together.

                            <strong>Now is the time!</strong> Abandoned and unwanted dogs need our help more than ever before. They can’t speak. They can’t look for a new owner by 
                            themselves. Shelters are constantly full and hundreds of dogs are killed every day. We can help people as well. There will be many people 
                            needed in order to run a large rescue shelter like this one. We would need to employ a lot of people to work on our “I Have a Dream Dog 
                            Rescue” project and we will help our economy as well.

                            I already mentioned him in my profile. I found only one picture of Bobby after my parents passed away. I used to have mainly pure bred dogs such as 
                            German Schnauzer and German Shepherds. But, I rescued several other dogs throughout the years. I remember when I rescued a female Pitbull when I lived 
                            in California, just in time before they called animal control. The pitbull stayed with my ex-wife for the rest of the pitbull's life. People have been 
                            afraid of Pitbulls and they still are because of hysterical hate created by TV and other media. But, the media never mentions the other breeds who killed 
                            people and children because of the stupidity of their owners. The media is now trying to create hate between white police officers and black citizens but 
                            they never mention how many white people have been killed by black police officers. But, I don't want to create a discussion with this theme here.

                            I found her in a Phoenix preserve, somebody just dumped her there. It was not easy to catch her because she was aggressive and wild. When I got closer, she 
                            stood her ground, didn't run away, was just staring and barking aggressively at me. I was impressed; she was so sharp so I gave her the name Sharpie. Then, 
                            I used an old trick and finally brought her home. She was wild. She didn't know how to play with a tennis ball; she went after my hands not after the ball. 
                            Then, I taught her a lot of tricks. She was a smart, perfect dog.
                        </p>
                        <p class="main-p">
                            I started with Presas because of her. I wanted a dog who would look like her but would be bigger for protection training. So, I went on the Internet and I found 
                            them: The beautiful Perro de Presa Canario.
                        </p>

                            Now what happened with Sharpie? When I purchased my first Presas, all my attention went to them and when I looked at Sharpie, I saw that she suffered emotionally. 
                            She was not the number one dog in our household anymore; I had to split my time between three dogs. She didn't play as much as she used to, she looked sad. Fortunately, 
                            my neighbors had been looking for a dog. So, I introduced them Sharpie to see if they would like her. They had been impressed with how well-trained she is and how she 
                            knows all the tricks, even hand signals. They took her home and I could visit her at any time because they lived across the street from me. Sharpie had a new masters 
                            who loved her, a new family where she was the dog #1 again. I was happy for her. When I came to visit her, she was glad to see me but not interested in me anymore—she 
                            had a new home.

                                        a word he was saying. Nevertheless, I understood his frustration and took him home. I have had him for one year 
                                        now. He is a sweet little boy: obedient, good guard dog, housebroken, doesn't eat much, eats almost anything, 
                                        likes to run a lot, and can handle other dogs of his size.

                            We will never forget the Denver massacre where over 3,000 dogs were
                            taken from their homes and families, and then killed
                        </p>
