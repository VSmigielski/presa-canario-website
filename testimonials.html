                                    When you look at the other breeder's testimonials, you can immediately see that many are fake because 
                                    they are written in the same style and there are no pictures attached. We, at Castle of Presa, believe 
                                    that our potential buyers need to know what type of experience our customers have had with our puppies 
                                    as well as dealing with us. So, we made our testimonial page even more interesting by adding audio with 
                                    VOICE testimonials.
                                </p>

                                                I got Churchill a while ago now he is 14 month old and I was very gun shy 
                                                about the purchase of Church because I was burned with another breeder I had 
                                                dealings with really bad, So D.D was kinda my rebound breeder (if you will) and 
                                                I put him through the ropes. Let me tell you he maintained a level of professionalism 
                                                like you read about.

                                                As far as Churchill he is doing so well, he is a true member of the family and loves us 
                                                all and we all love him. His training is doing very well he is very sharp with high drive 
                                                while working and a couch potato in the house just lazing around. All of what D.D said was 
                                                honest and forthright. I would be happy to place another one of his dogs in my home.

                                                everything we wanted. He is so protective of my wife. Just yesterday she was walking out of 
                                                the grocery store and a guy was walking behind her and Orphee was in the truck growling and 
                                                barking. You really did such a great job with him. I just hope you are still breeding once I'm in the market for another dog. Thanks again. I will call you later

                                                Now I have Britta for a few months, and I am so pleased with her, she has put on some 
                                                pounds and she is happy in Norway. When I picked her up at the airport, she was quiet 
                                                and a bit skeptical. But, after a couple of days she bounded with us and she has been 
                                                like a shadow ever since.

                                                we know that she will protect our house and property.

                                                know Sasha is doing great and growing up to be a beautiful girl! We are having a blast. 
                                                She and her big brother, Guiness (my black lab), are big buddies! Hope this email finds 
                                                you well. Here are some pics taken of Sasha last weekend.

                                                I just want to let you know that Lucy is doing well.  She is such a good girl, we started 
                                                obedience class and she was the best puppy there.  Everyone kept asking me what I do with 
                                                her to get to listen so well, she was the only puppy in the class of maybe 15 puppies that 
                                                sat when told.  She is everything I wanted in a dog.  She is a quick learner too.  She 
                                                reminds me of Electra from that little while we got to see her.  She is guarding, and she 
                                                is gentle with my son.  She does not mouth on us very much, if at all which is great.  It 
                                                is obvious that you spent a lot of time socializing and training your puppies, it shows.  
                                                Now I can see how important it is when puppies have good groundwork.  I wish we lived 
                                                closer to you so that you could train Lucy in protection when she gets older, but at least 
                                                I know you are always available for questions when I call. 
                                            </p>

                                                Another thing I wanted to tell you about, I was at my neighbors house with Lucy and my son 
                                                Benjamin. They  have 3 dogs, one of them is a small terrier type.  Lucy was paying no mind 
                                                to him at all, but then he jumped up on Benjamin and Lucy jumped on the dog instantly.  I 
                                                don't know if it was just a coincidence that she happened to jump on the dog right when he 
                                                jumped up on Benjamin, but she was paying him no mind up until then.  I think she was 
                                                protecting Benjamin. Again, I would like to thank you for Lucy.

                                                I purchased a puppy from DD out of Electra and could not be more pleased with my little guy 
                                                (actually he is pretty big now) – he is a true working dog and is in advanced training 
                                                already (9 months old). He also appears to be an excellent prospect for personal protection training
                                                – I told DD what I was looking for in a dog and he delivered – I actually picked my little guy up and 
                                                was able to see all of his dogs in the flesh (Orpheus is awesome and Electra is probably the most 
                                                impressive female Presa you will lay your eyes on) – They are extremely well
                                                taken care of and it is obvious DD spends a lot of time taking care of his presas and socializing the 
                                                pups. He has extensive knowledge about the Presa Canario breed and has answered all my questions thoroughly 
                                                regarding feeding, training, etc. – I highly recommend DD as a breeder if you are looking for a “real” Presa 
                                                Canario.

                            When you look at the other breeder's testimonials, you can immediately see that many are fake because 
                            they are written in the same style and there are no pictures attached. We, at Castle of Presa, believe 
                            that our potential buyers need to know what type of experience our customers have had with our puppies 
                            as well as dealing with us. So, we made our testimonial page even more interesting by adding audio with 
                            VOICE testimonials.

                                        I get stopped by people that compliment on him all the time. Here are some pictures.

                                        I got Churchill a while ago now he is 14 month old and I was very gun shy 
                                        about the purchase of Church because I was burned with another breeder I had 
                                        dealings with really bad, So D.D was kinda my rebound breeder (if you will) and 
                                        I put him through the ropes. Let me tell you he maintained a level of professionalism 
                                        like you read about.
                                    </p>

                                        He was great!!!

                                        As far as Churchill he is doing so well, he is a true member of the family and loves us 
                                        all and we all love him. His training is doing very well he is very sharp with high drive 
                                        while working and a couch potato in the house just lazing around. All of what D.D said was 
                                        honest and forthright. I would be happy to place another one of his dogs in my home.

                                        everything we wanted. He is so protective of my wife. Just yesterday she was walking out of

                                        barking. You really did such a great job with him. I just hope you are still breeding once I'm in the market for another dog. Thanks again. I will call you later

                                        pounds and she is happy in Norway. When I picked her up at the airport, she was quiet 
                                        and a bit skeptical. But, after a couple of days she bounded with us and she has been 
                                        like a shadow ever since.

                                        Britta is a perfect family dog, she loves our kids, but she is also good guard dog, so 
                                        we know that she will protect our house and property.

                                        Hi D.D.

                                        I just want to let you know that Lucy is doing well.  She is such a good girl, we started 
                                        obedience class and she was the best puppy there.  Everyone kept asking me what I do with 
                                        her to get to listen so well, she was the only puppy in the class of maybe 15 puppies that 
                                        sat when told.  She is everything I wanted in a dog.  She is a quick learner too.  She 
                                        reminds me of Electra from that little while we got to see her.  She is guarding, and she 
                                        is gentle with my son.  She does not mouth on us very much, if at all which is great.  It 
                                        is obvious that you spent a lot of time socializing and training your puppies, it shows.  
                                        Now I can see how important it is when puppies have good groundwork.  I wish we lived 
                                        closer to you so that you could train Lucy in protection when she gets older, but at least 
                                        I know you are always available for questions when I call. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="style100">
                                        Another thing I wanted to tell you about, I was at my neighbors house with Lucy and my son 
                                        Benjamin. They  have 3 dogs, one of them is a small terrier type.  Lucy was paying no mind 
                                        to him at all, but then he jumped up on Benjamin and Lucy jumped on the dog instantly.  I 
                                        don't know if it was just a coincidence that she happened to jump on the dog right when he 
                                        jumped up on Benjamin, but she was paying him no mind up until then.  I think she was 
                                        protecting Benjamin. Again, I would like to thank you for Lucy.

                                        I purchased a puppy from DD out of Electra and could not be more pleased with my little guy 
                                        (actually he is pretty big now) – he is a true working dog and is in advanced training 
                                        already (9 months old). He also appears to be an excellent prospect for personal protection training
                                        – I told DD what I was looking for in a dog and he delivered – I actually picked my little guy up and 
                                        was able to see all of his dogs in the flesh (Orpheus is awesome and Electra is probably the most 
                                        impressive female Presa you will lay your eyes on) – They are extremely well
                                        taken care of and it is obvious DD spends a lot of time taking care of his presas and socializing the 
                                        pups. He has extensive knowledge about the Presa Canario breed and has answered all my questions thoroughly 
                                        regarding feeding, training, etc. – I highly recommend DD as a breeder if you are looking for a “real” Presa 
                                        Canario.
