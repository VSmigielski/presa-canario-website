                                General Appearance
                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                The Presa Canario is a moderately large, powerfully constructed dog with a harsh-textured, 
                                flat coat. Their head is massive and cuboid. Their ears are set just above the line of the 
                                eye which may be cropped, naturally pendent or rose. The body of the Presa Canario is 
                                slightly longer than its height at the withers with a broad, deep chest. Females 
                                may be slightly longer and possess somewhat less rib spring than males. The Presa Canario's 
                                skin is thick and elastic. The distance from the withers to the elbow is roughly equal to 
                                the distance from the elbow to the ground. The tail is very thick at the base and tapers 
                                to a point. The tail is moderately high and reaches to the hock. The overall impression 
                                is that of an imposing, solid guard dog.
                            </p>

                            Characteristics
                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                The essential characteristics of the Presa are those which enable them to drive and herd 
                                cattle as well as to guard their home and family. These tasks require a powerful, agile, 
                                and courageous dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The Presa is extremely affectionate, 
                                docile and well behaved with its owner and family, but is wary of strangers and aggressive 
                                with other dogs.
                            </p>

                                Head
                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                The head is massive and cuboid in shape. When viewed from the side, the skull and muzzle are 
                                roughly parallel to one another which is joined by a well-defined, but not abrupt, stop. 
                                When the dog is alert, the skin forms several symmetrical wrinkles in the median furrow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Fault: Excessive wrinkling.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Serious Faults: Skull and muzzle not in correct proportion, abrupt stop.</em>
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                <strong>SKULL</strong> – The skull is cube-shaped, broad and slightly domed but without occipital protuberance. 
                                The width of the skull is about 3/5 of the length from occiput to nose. The zygomatic arch is 
                                very pronounced and there is a deep median furrow that diminishes in depth from the stop to 
                                the occiput. The cheek muscles are well developed without being pronounced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>MUZZLE</strong> – The muzzle forms a smaller cube that tapers just slightly from the stop to the nose. 
                                The length of the muzzle is roughly 2/5 of the length of the head, while the width is about 2/3 as wide as the 
                                skull. The bridge of the muzzle is flat and straight. The lips are moderately thick and pendulous with a black 
                                pigment. The top lip should fall naturally over the lower without excessive flews. When viewed from the front, 
                                the lips form an inverted “V” where they join.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>TEETH</strong> – The Perro de Presa Canario has a complete set of evenly spaced teeth which are set 
                                within a wide jaw. A scissors or reverse scissors bite is preferred; however, a level or slightly undershot 
                                bite is acceptable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Fault: Missing any tooth other than the first premolar.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Serious Fault: Excessively undershot bite.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Disqualification: Overshot bite.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>NOSE</strong> – The nose is wide and black. In profile, the nose fits cleanly into the square formed 
                                by the nasal bone and the front plane of the muzzle. The nose does not protrude beyond the front plane of the 
                                muzzle which would give a snipey look to the head.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>EYES</strong> – The eyes are slightly oval, sit level and wide apart, and range in color from medium 
                                to dark brown in accordance with coat color. Eyelids are close-fitting and black.
                                </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Serious faults: Light eyes, droopy eyelids, eyes sit close together or obliquely.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Disqualifications: Blue, gray, or yellow, non-matching eyes.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>EARS</strong> – The ears are of medium size, set just above the line of the eye and wide apart, and covered with short, 
                                fine hair. The ears may be natural (pendent or rose) or cropped. Pendent ears drop effortlessly to the sides 
                                of the head and rose ears are close fitting. Cropped ears are erect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Fault: High set ears.</em>

                                A properly proportioned Presa is about 20% longer (measured from prosternum to point of the buttocks) than 
                                their height (measured from the withers to the ground) and length of the front leg (measured from point of 
                                the elbow to the ground) should approximately equal one-half of the dog’s height. Females may be slightly 
                                longer in body. The withers are slightly elevated. The back and loin are strong but without prominent 
                                musculature. The back-line ascends slightly toward the croup which is just slightly higher than the 
                                withers. The croup is of medium length, wide and slightly sloping. Females normally have slightly wider 
                                croups. The loin is moderately short, muscular, and deep with moderate tuck-up. The ribs are well arched. 
                                The brisket extends to the elbow. The chest is broad and deep with well developed pectoral muscles. Ideally, 
                                the circumference of the deepest part of the chest should equal almost 1½ times the dog’s height at the 
                                withers.

                            General Appearance
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            The Presa Canario is a moderately large, powerfully constructed dog with a harsh-textured, 
                            flat coat. Their head is massive and cuboid. Their ears are set just above the line of the 
                            eye which may be cropped, naturally pendent or rose. The body of the Presa Canario is 
                            slightly longer than its height at the withers with a broad, deep chest. Females 
                            may be slightly longer and possess somewhat less rib spring than males. The Presa Canario's 
                            skin is thick and elastic. The distance from the withers to the elbow is roughly equal to 
                            the distance from the elbow to the ground. The tail is very thick at the base and tapers 
                            to a point. The tail is moderately high and reaches to the hock. The overall impression 
                            is that of an imposing, solid guard dog.

                        Characteristics
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            The essential characteristics of the Presa are those which enable them to drive and herd 
                            cattle as well as to guard their home and family. These tasks require a powerful, agile, 
                            and courageous dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The Presa is extremely affectionate,

                        <p>
                            The head is massive and cuboid in shape. When viewed from the side, the skull and muzzle are 
                            roughly parallel to one another which is joined by a well-defined, but not abrupt, stop. 
                            When the dog is alert, the skin forms several symmetrical wrinkles in the median furrow.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            <strong>SKULL</strong> – The skull is cube-shaped, broad and slightly domed but without occipital protuberance. 
                            The width of the skull is about 3/5 of the length from occiput to nose. The zygomatic arch is 
                            very pronounced and there is a deep median furrow that diminishes in depth from the stop to 
                            the occiput. The cheek muscles are well developed without being pronounced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>MUZZLE</strong> – The muzzle forms a smaller cube that tapers just slightly from the stop to the nose. 
                            The length of the muzzle is roughly 2/5 of the length of the head, while the width is about 2/3 as wide as the 
                            skull. The bridge of the muzzle is flat and straight. The lips are moderately thick and pendulous with a black 
                            pigment. The top lip should fall naturally over the lower without excessive flews. When viewed from the front, 
                            the lips form an inverted “V” where they join.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>TEETH</strong> – The Perro de Presa Canario has a complete set of evenly spaced teeth which are set 
                            within a wide jaw. A scissors or reverse scissors bite is preferred; however, a level or slightly undershot 
                            bite is acceptable.

                            <strong>NOSE</strong> – The nose is wide and black. In profile, the nose fits cleanly into the square formed 
                            by the nasal bone and the front plane of the muzzle. The nose does not protrude beyond the front plane of the 
                            muzzle which would give a snipey look to the head.

                        <p>
                            <strong>EYES</strong> – The eyes are slightly oval, sit level and wide apart, and range in color from medium 
                            to dark brown in accordance with coat color. Eyelids are close-fitting and black.

                            <strong>EARS</strong>EARS – The ears are of medium size, set just above the line of the eye and wide apart, and covered with short, 
                            fine hair. The ears may be natural (pendent or rose) or cropped. Pendent ears drop effortlessly to the sides 
                            of the head and rose ears are close fitting. Cropped ears are erect.

                            A properly proportioned Presa is about 20% longer (measured from prosternum to point of the buttocks) than 
                            their height (measured from the withers to the ground) and length of the front leg (measured from point of 
                            the elbow to the ground) should approximately equal one-half of the dog’s height. Females may be slightly 
                            longer in body. The withers are slightly elevated. The back and loin are strong but without prominent 
                            musculature. The back-line ascends slightly toward the croup which is just slightly higher than the 
                            withers. The croup is of medium length, wide and slightly sloping. Females normally have slightly wider 
                            croups. The loin is moderately short, muscular, and deep with moderate tuck-up. The ribs are well arched. 
                            The brisket extends to the elbow. The chest is broad and deep with well developed pectoral muscles. Ideally, 
                            the circumference of the deepest part of the chest should equal almost 1½ times the dog’s height at the 
                            withers.
