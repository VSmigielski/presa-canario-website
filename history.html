However, we at Castle of Presa believe that the Dogo Canario is a different breed since the standard that Dogos follow is not the original Presa standard.">

                                <p>
                                    The Presa is a Molosser type of dog which originated on the Canary Islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria in 
                                    the Canary Archipelago. The Canary Islands were actually named after the dog, not a famous bird. In fact, 
                                    the word "cane" gave rise to the islands name. These dogs were widely spread on the territory of the Canary 
                                    Islands before the Spanish settled there. The islands where referred to as "The Islands of the Dogs."
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-2">
                                    Around the eighteenth century, the English colonists, traders, and merchants brought their Bandogges and 
                                    Tiedogs to the Canary Islands. Shortly thereafter, the English introduced their favorite breeds of 
                                    Bull/Terriers, Bulldogs, and Mastiffs, and began crossbreeding with the existent Perro de Presa of the 
                                    Canary Islands.  
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-5">
                                    The Presa Canario was developed by farmers in the Canary Islands to serve as a guard dog: to guard their 
                                    homes, farms, livestock, and to subdue the cattle for the butchers. They were later used for dog fights 
                                    along with other breeds until the 1940s when dog fights were prohibited. Consequently, the Perro de Presa 
                                    Canario decreased greatly in numbers. Just a few Presa dogs where still used by farmers as guard dogs and 
                                    to catch as well as hold the cattle. Reconstruction of the breed began in the early 1970's by various 
                                    aficionados who sought to preserve the heritage of the Presa Canario.  Throughout the next decade, breeders 
                                    began searching for what they believed were the most traditional examples of the Presa Canario in temperament, 
                                    courage, guard instinct, and other aspects.  These breeds may have included the Bullterrier, the American 
                                    Staffordshire Terrier, the Great Dane, the Neapolitan Mastiff, the Fila Brasileiro, the American Bulldog, the 
                                    English Bulldog, the Bullmastiff, the Spanish Mastiff, the Doberman, the Dogue de Bordeaux, the Spanish Alano 
                                    and the Perro de Ganado Majorero.  Clearly, the gene pool for the modern Presa Canario is quite extensive and 
                                    can still produce atypical specimens of this nascent breed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first few Presas were imported to U.S. in the late 1980s. Their popularity was on the rise. Dog fanciers 
                                    were anxious to own and show this rare dog breed. Nevertheless, AKC registers the Presa Canario only under 
                                    their FSS program which is useless for Presa owners. Fortunately, other American Presa Canario clubs were 
                                    founded. Now, you can register your Presa with UKC or UPPCC. However, if you live in Europe and want to 
                                    register your Presa with FCI, you need to change his original name to Dogo Canario. According to FCI standards, 
                                    your “Dogo” will not be allowed to have a black coat or the traditional white markings on their belly, chest, 
                                    and feet. Also, cropping their ears is illegal in Europe.

                                    What is the difference between a Presa Canario and a Dogo Canario?
                                </h6>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    The word “presa” can be translated to “gripper”. The Tenerife Club Espaňol del Dogo Canario (CEDC) did 
                                     not feel comfortable with the name “gripper” so they changed it to “Dogo” in 2001 to make it politically 
                                     correct. They concentrated more on the show-look to satisfy their judges than on performance and working 
                                     abilities. Fédération Cynologique Internationale, also known as the FCI, is an International Kennel Club 
                                     with 84 member countries which are mainly in Europe and it is based in Belgium. On June 3, 2001, the FCI aided by 
                                     the CEDC, officially declared and recognized the "Perro de Presa Canario breed" as the "Dogo Canario", 
                                     eliminating the black coat, traditional markings, and maximum weight limitation. <strong> The FCI 
                                     changed the "unlimited weight" of the Dogo Canario to the original standards of the Presa Canario after 
                                     almost 15 years (approximately 2015-2016). </strong> The change from “Presa” to “Dogo” was an insult to 
                                     many traditional Presa breeders in the Canary Islands because they felt that Presa dogs have always been 
                                     a large part of their heritage and always referred to them as Presa. The FCI is getting closer to the 
                                     acceptance of the Presa Canario. As of December 2018/January 2019, the FCI reverted back to "Presa."
                                </p>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    Because, there are still several Canary Islands breeders who do not accept the change, and breed real Presa 
                                    based on the old Bardino Majorero bloodline (Bardino is an original Canary Island dog, which played a key 
                                    role in the creation of Presa Canario), with original appearance, original temperament and register their 
                                    Presa with U.S. clubs such as UPPCC, as Presa Canario. With this change, the CEDC with FCI actually created 
                                    a new breed called "Dogo Canario" because the Presa Canario still exists with its original standards and is 
                                    supported by the UKC club. The United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the Perro de Presa Canario on January 1, 
                                    2003 with all traditional marking and black coat.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    We, at Castle of Presa, are supportive of the traditional Presa bloodlines with working abilities, original 
                                    appearance: sporting a black coat, and traditional markings. We breed Presa (not "Dogo") and will only register our dogs 
                                    with UPPCC.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    Even though the Presa has a long and glorious heritage, it is a relatively new breed. Since 2001, many breeders went 
                                    in different directions with many ignoring the original Presa with traditional appearance and working abilities. They began breeding the Dogo Canario for dog shows. We can still see a significant difference between Presas and Dogos.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style129 mb-5">
                                    The Presa Canario is an extraordinary dog. When properly socialized and trained, there is no better dog than a Presa. 
                                    Presa Canario can now participate in all UPPCC, AKC and UKC events which include obedience trials, agility trials, 
                                    weight pulls, and personal protection events. There have already been reports about Presas being titled with PSA, 
                                    Schutzhund, and French Ring. This clearly proves the Presa’s amazing working ability.

                                    the Canary Archipelago. The Canary Islands were actually named after the dog, not a famous bird. In fact, 
                                    the word "cane" gave rise to the islands name. These dogs were widely spread on the territory of the Canary 
                                    Islands before the Spanish settled there. The islands where referred to as "The Islands of the Dogs."

                                    Around the eighteenth century, the English colonists, traders, and merchants brought their Bandogges and 
                                    Tiedogs to the Canary Islands. Shortly thereafter, the English introduced their favorite breeds of 
                                    Bull/Terriers, Bulldogs, and Mastiffs, and began crossbreeding with the existent Perro de Presa of the 
                                    Canary Islands.

                                    The Presa Canario was developed by farmers in the Canary Islands to serve as a guard dog: to guard their 
                                    homes, farms, livestock, and to subdue the cattle for the butchers. They were later used for dog fights 
                                    along with other breeds until the 1940s when dog fights were prohibited. Consequently, the Perro de Presa 
                                    Canario decreased greatly in numbers. Just a few Presa dogs where still used by farmers as guard dogs and 
                                    to catch as well as hold the cattle. Reconstruction of the breed began in the early 1970's by various 
                                    aficionados who sought to preserve the heritage of the Presa Canario.  Throughout the next decade, breeders 
                                    began searching for what they believed were the most traditional examples of the Presa Canario in temperament, 
                                    courage, guard instinct, and other aspects.  These breeds may have included the Bullterrier, the American 
                                    Staffordshire Terrier, the Great Dane, the Neapolitan Mastiff, the Fila Brasileiro, the American Bulldog, the 
                                    English Bulldog, the Bullmastiff, the Spanish Mastiff, the Doberman, the Dogue de Bordeaux, the Spanish Alano 
                                    and the Perro de Ganado Majorero.  Clearly, the gene pool for the modern Presa Canario is quite extensive and 
                                    can still produce atypical specimens of this nascent breed.

                                    The first few Presas were imported to U.S. in the late 1980s. Their popularity was on the rise. Dog fanciers 
                                    were anxious to own and show this rare dog breed. Nevertheless, AKC registers the Presa Canario only under 
                                    their FSS program which is useless for Presa owners. Fortunately, other American Presa Canario clubs were 
                                    founded. Now, you can register your Presa with UKC or UPPCC. However, if you live in Europe and want to 
                                    register your Presa with FCI, you need to change his original name to Dogo Canario. According to FCI standards, 
                                    your “Dogo” will not be allowed to have a black coat or the traditional white markings on their belly, chest, 
                                    and feet. Also, cropping their ears is illegal in Europe.

                            What is the difference between a Presa Canario and a Dogo Canario?
                        </h6>
                        <p class="style129">
                            The word “presa” can be translated to “gripper”. The Tenerife Club Espaňol del Dogo Canario (CEDC) did 
                             not feel comfortable with the name “gripper” so they changed it to “Dogo” in 2001 to make it politically 
                             correct. They concentrated more on the show-look to satisfy their judges than on performance and working 
                             abilities. Fédération Cynologique Internationale, also known as the FCI, is an International Kennel Club 
                             with 84 member countries which are mainly in Europe and it is based in Belgium. In 2001 the FCI aided by 
                             the CEDC, officially declared and recognized the "Perro de Presa Canario breed" as the "Dogo Canario", 
                             eliminating the black coat, traditional markings, and maximum weight limitation. <strong> The FCI 
                             changed the "unlimited weight" of the Dogo Canario to the original standards of the Presa Canario after 
                             almost 15 years (approximately 2015-2016). </strong> The change from “Presa” to “Dogo” was an insult to 
                             many traditional Presa breeders in the Canary Islands because they felt that Presa dogs have always been 
                             a large part of their heritage and always referred to them as Presa. The FCI is getting closer to the 
                             acceptance of the Presa Canario. As of December 2018/January 2019, the FCI reverted back to "Presa."
                        </p>
                        <p class="style129 mb-3">
                            Because, there are still several Canary Islands breeders who do not accept the change, and breed real Presa 
                            based on the old Bardino Majorero bloodline (Bardino is an original Canary Island dog, which played a key 
                            role in the creation of Presa Canario), with original appearance, original temperament and register their 
                            Presa with U.S. clubs such as UPPCC, as Presa Canario. With this change, the CEDC with FCI actually created 
                            a new breed called "Dogo Canario". It is obvious, that if two dogs have two different standards they are two 
                            different dogs.

                            We, at Castle of Presa, are supportive of the traditional Presa bloodlines with working abilities, original 
                            appearance: sporting a black coat, and traditional markings. We breed Presa (not "Dogo") and will only register our dogs 
                            with UPPCC.
                        </p>

                            Even though the Presa has a long and glorious heritage, it is a relatively new breed. Since 2001, many breeders went 
                            in different directions with many ignoring the original Presa with traditional appearance and working abilities. They 
                            began breeding the Dogo Canario for dog shows. We can still see a significant difference between Presas and Dogos.

                            The Presa Canario is an extraordinary dog. When properly socialized and trained, there is no better dog than a Presa. 
                            Presa Canario can now participate in all UPPCC, AKC and UKC events which include obedience trials, agility trials, 
                            weight pulls, and personal protection events. There have already been reports about Presas being titled with PSA, 
                            Schutzhund, and French Ring. This clearly proves the Presa’s amazing working ability.
