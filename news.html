                                    Well, you can only meet Rambo if you accidentally get on my property. He sleeps most 
                                    of the day, but when he hears or smells something suspicious, he is alert. When I used 
                                    to go for a walk with my dogs to the desert trails, I was always carrying a gun.

                                    my 45, a lot more dangerous and deadlier.

                                </p>

                                    It's simple. If two dogs have different standards, they are two different 
                                    dogs, period. In the beginning there was a Perro de Presa Canario. However, 
                                    in 2001 there was a group of people who created a new breed which they named 
                                    Dogo Canario. Dogo was created based on the Presa Canario blood lines. Those 
                                    Dogo breeders went different directions than Presa breeders. They bred Presa 
                                    with Mastiffs, Dobermans and Great Danes, to achieve the look they like, so 
                                    you can see these large Dogos with a longer muzzle. Real Presas are supposed 
                                    to have a shorter muzzle, large block-shaped head (like Hercules or Phantom) 
                                    and according to the old standards, males shouldn't be larger than 120 lbs. 
                                    The oldest breeder of the real Presa Canario is Irema Curto kennel based in 
                                    Tenerife, Canary Islands. If you take a close look at Curto's Presa and at 
                                    the other breeders Dogos, you will see the difference in appearance and also 
                                    in temperament.

                            Well, you can only meet Rambo if you accidentally get on my property. He sleeps most 
                            of the day, but when he hears or smells something suspicious, he is alert. When I used 
                            to go for a walk with my dogs to the desert trails, I was always carrying a gun.

                            Not anymore!

                        <p class="ms-3 style46 mt-none">
                            Carrying a gun on my belt is heavy, but now I have Rambo. He is extremely muscular, strong, 
                            fearless and fast. All I have to do is unleash Rambo and the bullet is released, faster than 
                            my 45, a lot more dangerous and deadlier.
                        </p>

                            Now I have to teach Rambo to release, or let go, and come back to me. After all his training 
                            will be done, Rambo will eventually be available for sale.

                            <strong>Why is Presa and Dogo not the same breed?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="ms-3 style46">
                            It's simple. If two dogs have different standards, they are two different 
                            dogs, period. In the beginning there was a Perro de Presa Canario. However, 
                            in 2001 there was a group of people who created a new breed which they named 
                            Dogo Canario. Dogo was created based on the Presa Canario blood lines. Those 
                            Dogo breeders went different directions than Presa breeders. They bred Presa 
                            with Mastiffs, Dobermans and Great Danes, to achieve the look they like, so 
                            you can see these large Dogos with a longer muzzle. Real Presas are supposed 
                            to have a shorter muzzle, large block-shaped head (like Hercules or Phantom) 
                            and according to the old standards, males shouldn't be larger than 120 lbs. 
                            The oldest breeder of the real Presa Canario is Irema Curto kennel based in 
                            Tenerife, Canary Islands. If you take a close look at Curto's Presa and at 
                            the other breeders Dogos, you will see the difference in appearance and also 
                            in temperament.
