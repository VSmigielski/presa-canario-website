History of Perro de Presa Canario
The Presa is a Molosser type of dog which originated on the Canary Islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria in the Canary Archipelago. The Canary Islands were actually named after the dog, not a famous bird. In fact, the word "cane" gave rise to the islands name. These dogs were widely spread on the territory of the Canary Islands before the Spanish settled there. The islands where referred to as "The Islands of the Dogs."

Around the eighteenth century, the English colonists, traders, and merchants brought their Bandogges and Tiedogs to the Canary Islands. Shortly thereafter, the English introduced their favorite breeds of Bull/Terriers, Bulldogs, and Mastiffs, and began crossbreeding with the existent Perro de Presa of the Canary Islands.

The Presa Canario was developed by farmers in the Canary Islands to serve as a guard dog: to guard their homes, farms, livestock, and to subdue the cattle for the butchers. They were later used for dog fights along with other breeds until the 1940s when dog fights were prohibited. Consequently, the Perro de Presa Canario decreased greatly in numbers. Just a few Presa dogs where still used by farmers as guard dogs and to catch as well as hold the cattle. Reconstruction of the breed began in the early 1970's by various aficionados who sought to preserve the heritage of the Presa Canario.  Throughout the next decade, breeders began searching for what they believed were the most traditional examples of the Presa Canario in temperament, courage, guard instinct, and other aspects.  These breeds may have included the Bullterrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, the Great Dane, the Neapolitan Mastiff, the Fila Brasileiro, the American Bulldog, the English Bulldog, the Bullmastiff, the Spanish Mastiff, the Doberman, the Dogue de Bordeaux, the Spanish Alano and the Perro de Ganado Majorero.  Clearly, the gene pool for the modern Presa Canario is quite extensive and can still produce atypical specimens of this nascent breed.

The first few Presas were imported to U.S. in the late 1980s. Their popularity was on the rise. Dog fanciers were anxious to own and show this rare dog breed. Nevertheless, AKC registers the Presa Canario only under their FSS program which is useless for Presa owners. Fortunately, other American Presa Canario clubs were founded. Now, you can register your Presa with UKC or UPPCC. However, if you live in Europe and want to register your Presa with FCI, you need to change his original name to Dogo Canario. According to FCI standards, your “Dogo” will not be allowed to have a black coat or the traditional white markings on their belly, chest, and feet. Also, cropping their ears is illegal in Europe.

The FCI, aided by the CEPC, recognized the "Perro de Presa Canario breed" as the "Dogo Canario" on June 3, 2001 and eliminated the black coat, traditional markings and maximum weight limitation. Because, Presa Canario still exists with their original standards and it's supported by UKC club,
the FCI actualy created a new breed.

The United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the Perro de Presa Canario on January 1, 2003 with all traditional marking and black coat.
