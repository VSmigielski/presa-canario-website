ATTENTION:
Before you purchase a puppy

I am a totally different breeder than any other breeder you might know. Breeding Presas is my passion, my hobby. I have a full time job and don't live off of my dogs. However, there are many puppy-mill breeders out there having large amounts of dogs and treating them very bad. They keep them in kennels full time as if they were livestock, never letting them out, not cleaning their kennels so the dogs step in their own poop and urine all of their life. The puppy mill owners don't give them fresh water, they let them drink bad water while feeding them only 3 times a week with "bulk dog food" (a mixed dog food that expired a long time ago or was discontinued because of recalls). Commercial dog food is already made out of garbage so bulk dog food is the worst of the worst. But, it's cheap and it's made only for stinky dogs right? Why people disrespect these great animals...I would like to know. Dogs are very clean animals. They like to drink fresh water and eat fresh meat. Dogs are not protected from these money-hungry humans. Only we can help these dogs and puppies to keep them from suffering. When we will not purchase from these so-called "commercial breeders", they will eventually stop breeding. Dogs should not be treated as business. Why? What are the principles of business? Get something cheap or for free and sell it with a high profit. Dogs deserve better. Those puppy-mill breeders are those who fill up the shelters with puppies and dogs they can't sell. The only way you can stop these money hungry breeders and help those poor dogs who suffer in their kennels is just not to buy from them. It's as simple as that.

So, when you are shopping for a puppy you should ask these 5 important questions:

1. Does the breeder you're looking into have any old dogs? 
This should be your first as well as the most important question. Breeders who don't care about their dogs usually don't have any old dogs. They usually put them down at the age of 6-7 years since they are not producing enough puppies. Or, they give them to people for free. Who would want an old dog? Sometimes they dump them in shelters. What a sad end for a beautiful champion male or female. An old dog should retire in the environment where they live. We have all of our old dogs. Some already have arthritis from old age but we are giving them medicine to make them feel better and comfortable. The most important thing is that they live in the environment that they know, an environment where they lived all of their life. They might be gray and ugly, but we still Love them.

2. How many breeding dogs does the breeder have? 
There is no reason to have more than 4 or 5 breeding dogs. If someone has more than 10 breeding dogs, it is a puppy-mill. And dogs in puppy-mills have no life.

<p>3. What does the breeder feed their dogs with? </p>
<p>Puppy-mill breeders will lie to you. They will tell you that they feed their dogs premium dog food such as Origin, but they usually feed their dogs "bulk" dog food. Bulk dog food is commercial dog food that expired and it's cheap, sold by the bucket. We at C.O.P. feed ours dogs home made raw meat and vegetables. Raw meat is the healthiest diet for dogs and cats. Dogs who are on a raw diet never get sick. They will not die from dog food that was on recall, from cancer caused by dog food, and don't get sick from salmonella that can be found in dog food. As a new dog guardian, do yourself a favor and educate yourself a little, and please read these few pages from the book written by veterinarian Dr.W.O.Belfield, DVM published already in 1981:

4. Does the breeder keep their dogs in kennels full-time? 
Healthy dogs need exercise and to be socialized in different environments such as your home, car and walking in the city. Presa dogs that are kept in kennels full-time get depressed or wild.

5. Ask the breeder if the parents of a puppy you are going to purchase has had their hips X-Rayed. 
Most breeders never X-ray the hips of their dogs because it costs money ($250 to $350 in many cases). Then, they produce puppies with hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is a genetic problem. You can find a copy of our dogs hips X-Ray on our website.

Then, after these 5 questions, you can start asking other questions such as prices and etc.

Our puppies 
They are raised in our home and the surrounding environment so they are properly socialized before they find a new home. The socializing and training of puppies at the early stages of their life causes a positive effect on your dog’s life and their future. In comparison, large kennels or high volume breeders are unable to spend time with newborn puppies or house-train the puppies when they have several litters per month. Presa puppies are very
energetic and like to play with robust physicality.
If you start to play hard with them, they play even harder. If any dog is playing with children, supervision is always recommended.
Our puppies come with UPPCC registration and a health guarantee. All our puppies come from the finest Spanish bloodlines. You can contact us for more information about our guarantees.

Presa dogs 
They like to be a part of the family. They don't do well if left alone in a kennel full time and <strong>as nose breathing dogs, they can suffer from heat more than some other breeds</strong>. If you live in places like Arizona, where the Summer is really hot, you cannot keep your Presa outside. A supply of cold water is necessary 24/7. During hot days in Arizona, we keep our dogs outside only over night and bring them inside before 10 am, where they can enjoy the cool air from the AC when the outside temperature is 115-125F. As we mentioned before, Presas don't do well in extreme heat or even the opposite, extreme cold. If you go hiking with your Presa where the temperature will reach 85F or more, this will likely cause heat stroke and lead to the death of your puppy.

Why purchase a puppy from Castle of Presa?

Our puppies are home-raised (not farm-raised) with love (when you give love, you receive love).
Our puppies are socialized before they leave our kennel. We play with them every day in our house, outside, in our backyard and in our outdoor kennels. Dogs are social animals; they can’t be thrown into a kennel and be left alone like farm animals. If they only live in a  kennel without any human contact, they will get wild, angry, or depressed. 
Most of our puppies are crate trained. We use a very easy method for crate training that does not put too much stress on the puppy during the training. Crate training is especially important when puppies need to be shipped so they can handle the stress from the shipping better.
Most of our puppies are housebroken or they would be easily trained in their new environment. We start potty training at early age.
Some of our puppies begin guarding as soon as they reach 8 weeks while others may take up to 4 months.
We offer a handler course for new puppy owners. We come to your home and show you how to properly take care of your puppy as well as basic training. After this demonstration, you can continue with the training by yourself. No Petco/ Petsmart training needed. These companies will only inflict damage on your puppy.
Free lifetime support advice with any health or puppy training issues for our clients.
Our puppies are weaned on human-grade raw meat purchased from health food stores. Raw meat is the healthiest and the best diet you can give to your dog. We also add fresh vegetables, frozen berries, and vitamin supplements to our puppies' diet. This will boost the puppy's immune system and keep them healthy. This way you will save a lot of money on the vet in the long run.  
We always give feeding instructions to new guardians of our puppies to avoid Pano and other health problems that could be caused by an unconscious owner.

What you can expect from other breeders?
Their puppies are raised in small kennels or cages like hens, pigs, or other farm animals. They also call them "farm raised dogs".
Their puppies are never socialized. As a result of this, the puppies are scared, too shy, or they scream and get wild and crazy.
These puppies are seldom interested in humans; they can even develop mental problems.

Why would anybody bother with crate training? If they do, then they lock puppies in the crate for several days and
let them scream and give them no choice so they would have to poop and pee in the crate in the same place as they sleep. This is against their nature.  When puppies are shipped, they usually suffer emotionally because they were not prepared for the trip.

Potty training? No way! Puppies are usually messy because they are left in their own mess and are only cleaned before the shipping. They often have fleas, ticks, and other parasites or health issues. Many times it’s impossible for new guardians to housebreak these puppies at all !!!

Their puppies are often fed with commercial dog food (Iams, Science Diet, Eucanuba Puppy, etc.) so they grow too fast which causes chronic diarrhea, cancer, allergies, skin problems, and other diseases.

When the sale is completed, many other breeders do not care what you do with the puppy or how it is progressing.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Feeding puppies with commercial dog food can lead to many health problems such as cancer, kidney problems, intestinal problems, allergies and even mental problems. And yes, mental problems and brain damage can occur due to commercial dog food. We all have been fooled by dog food companies for years. Just watch this video on how dog food is made: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9DTzDfYMxo&ab_channel=slibby62" target="_blank" class="view-links">Rendering process</a>

If you are feeding your dogs with commercial dog food and believe the pictures of fresh meat printed on the bags is what you are getting, then you are nothing but fool and I feel sorry for your dog. The real ingredients of dog food was already discovered in the early 70s. However,
people choose to ignore that fact and still feed their pets with commercial dog food which poisons their dogs and cats. Do yourself a favor and educate yourself a little. Read these few pages from the book written by veterinarian Dr.W.O.Belfield, D.V.M. published in 1981:
