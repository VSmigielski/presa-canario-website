                                <h6 class="style125">What type of dog is a Presa?</h6>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    Even though Presa Canarios are not listed as working dogs, they belong to the working group of dogs and are 
                                    prized as protectors and guardians. The Presa Canario breed is gentle and extremely loyal to their family, but 
                                    distrustful to strangers, always watching and keeping an eye out for potential danger. The Presa 
                                    Canario is territorial and has a natural instinct for guarding. No special training for guarding is 
                                    needed. This highly intelligent canine is generally calm, quiet, and moves slowly. However, when called 
                                    to action, the Presa, with his muscular body, can be deceptively agile and fast.

                                    When you are at home with your Presa lying down by your feet, either while working on your computer or watching 
                                    TV, you can feel safe and secure knowing that this large, muscular beauty, will give his life in order 
                                    to save yours. The Presa's courage and genuine beauty is incomparable with any other breed. We just love our 
                                    Presas.

                                    What is the difference between a Presa Canario and a Dogo Canario?
                                </h6>
                                <p class="style129">
                                    The word “presa” can be translated to “gripper”. The Tenerife Club Espaňol del Dogo Canario (CEDC) did 
                                     not feel comfortable with the name “gripper” so they changed it to “Dogo” in 2001 to make it politically 
                                     correct. They concentrated more on the show-look to satisfy their judges than on performance and working 
                                     abilities. Fédération Cynologique Internationale, also known as the FCI, is an International Kennel Club 
                                     with 84 member countries which are mainly in Europe and it is based in Belgium. In 2001 the FCI aided by 
                                     the CEDC, officially declared and recognized the "Perro de Presa Canario breed" as the "Dogo Canario", 
                                     eliminating the black coat, traditional markings, and maximum weight limitation. <strong> The FCI 
                                     changed the "unlimited weight" of the Dogo Canario to the original standards of the Presa Canario after 
                                     almost 15 years (approximately 2015-2016). </strong> The change from “Presa” to “Dogo” was an insult to 
                                     many traditional Presa breeders in the Canary Islands because they felt that Presa dogs have always been 
                                     a large part of their heritage and always referred to them as Presa. The FCI is getting closer to the 
                                     acceptance of the Presa Canario. As of December 2018/January 2019, the FCI reverted back to "Presa."

                                <p class="style129">
                                    Because, there are still several Canary Islands breeders who do not accept the change, and breed real Presa 
                                    based on the old Bardino Majorero bloodline (Bardino is an original Canary Island dog, which played a key 
                                    role in the creation of Presa Canario), with original appearance, original temperament and register their 
                                    Presa with U.S. clubs such as UPPCC, as Presa Canario. With this change, the CEDC with FCI actually created 
                                    a new breed called "Dogo Canario". It is obvious, that if two dogs have two different standards they are two 
                                    different dogs.
                                </p>

                                    We, at Castle of Presa, are supportive of the traditional Presa bloodlines with working abilities, original 
                                    appearance: sporting a black coat, and traditional markings. We breed Presa (not "Dogo") and will only register our dogs 
                                    with UPPCC.
                                </p>

                                    Even though the Presa has a long and glorious heritage, it is a relatively new breed. Since 2001, many breeders went 
                                    in different directions with many ignoring the original Presa with traditional appearance and working abilities. They began breeding the Dogo Canario for dog shows. We can still see a significant difference between Presas and Dogos.

                                    The Presa Canario is an extraordinary dog. When properly socialized and trained, there is no better dog than a Presa. 
                                    Presa Canario can now participate in all UPPCC, AKC and UKC events which include obedience trials, agility trials, 
                                    weight pulls, and personal protection events. There have already been reports about Presas being titled with PSA, 
                                    Schutzhund, and French Ring. This clearly proves the Presa’s amazing working ability.

                                    Just as ancient aristocrats used to value their Great Danes or English Mastiffs in ancient Europe, the Presa Canario, with 
                                    their great appearance and guarding abilities, is gaining popularity, making them popular in the homes of the wealthy.
