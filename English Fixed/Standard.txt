<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
	General Appearance
</h6>
<p>
The Presa Canario is a moderately large, powerfully constructed dog with a harsh-textured, 
flat coat. Their head is massive and cuboid. Their ears are set just above the line of the 
eye which may be cropped, naturally pendent or rose. The body of the Presa Canario is 
slightly longer than its height at the withers with a broad, deep chest. Females 
may be slightly longer and possess somewhat less rib spring than males. The Presa Canario's 
skin is thick and elastic. The distance from the withers to the elbow is roughly equal to 
the distance from the elbow to the ground. The tail is very thick at the base and tapers 
to a point. The tail is moderately high and reaches to the hock. The overall impression 
is that of an imposing, solid guard dog.
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Characteristics
</h6>
<p>
The essential characteristics of the Presa are those which enable them to drive and herd 
cattle as well as to guard their home and family. These tasks require a powerful, agile, 
and courageous dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The Presa is extremely affectionate, 
docile and well behaved with its owner and family, but is wary of strangers and aggressive 
with other dogs.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious Fault: Unstable temperament</em>
</p>

<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Head
</h6>
<p>
The head is massive and cuboid in shape. When viewed from the side, the skull and muzzle are 
roughly parallel to one another which is joined by a well-defined, but not abrupt, stop. 
When the dog is alert, the skin forms several symmetrical wrinkles in the median furrow.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fault: Excessive wrinkling.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious Faults: Skull and muzzle not in correct proportion, abrupt stop.</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
<strong>SKULL</strong> – The skull is cube-shaped, broad and slightly domed but without occipital protuberance. 
The width of the skull is about 3/5 of the length from occiput to nose. The zygomatic arch is 
very pronounced and there is a deep median furrow that diminishes in depth from the stop to 
the occiput. The cheek muscles are well developed without being pronounced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MUZZLE</strong> – The muzzle forms a smaller cube that tapers just slightly from the stop to the nose. 
The length of the muzzle is roughly 2/5 of the length of the head, while the width is about 2/3 as wide as the 
skull. The bridge of the muzzle is flat and straight. The lips are moderately thick and pendulous with a black 
pigment. The top lip should fall naturally over the lower without excessive flews. When viewed from the front, 
the lips form an inverted “V” where they join.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TEETH</strong> – The Perro de Presa Canario has a complete set of evenly spaced teeth which are set 
within a wide jaw. A scissors or reverse scissors bite is preferred; however, a level or slightly undershot 
bite is acceptable.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fault: Missing any tooth other than the first premolar.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious Fault: Excessively undershot bite.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Disqualification: Overshot bite.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOSE</strong> – The nose is wide and black. In profile, the nose fits cleanly into the square formed 
by the nasal bone and the front plane of the muzzle. The nose does not protrude beyond the front plane of the 
muzzle which would give a snipey look to the head.
</p>
<p>
<strong>EYES</strong> – The eyes are slightly oval, sit level and wide apart, and range in color from medium 
to dark brown in accordance with coat color. Eyelids are close-fitting and black.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Light eyes, droopy eyelids, eyes sit close together or obliquely.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Disqualifications: Blue, gray, or yellow, non-matching eyes.</em>
</p>
<p>
EARS – The ears are of medium size, set just above the line of the eye and wide apart, and covered with short, 
fine hair. The ears may be natural (pendent or rose) or cropped. Pendent ears drop effortlessly to the sides 
of the head and rose ears are close fitting. Cropped ears are erect.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fault: High set ears.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Neck
</h6>
<p>
The neck is cylindrical, thick, well-muscled, and slightly shorter than the length of the head. There are 
loose folds of skin at the throat which form a slight dewlap.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Excessive dewlap, long or weak neck.</em>
</p>

<h6 class="style125 mt-2"> 
Forequarters
<h6>
<p>
The shoulders are muscular and well laid back. The upper arm is of good length and well-angled so that the front 
legs are well-set behind the point of the shoulder. The elbows are set slightly outwards from the body. The front 
legs are straight, well-muscled, and heavy boned. The pasterns are strong, short, and nearly vertical.
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Body
</h6>
<p>
A properly proportioned Presa is about 20% longer (measured from prosternum to point of the buttocks) than 
their height (measured from the withers to the ground) and length of the front leg (measured from point of 
the elbow to the ground) should approximately equal one-half of the dog’s height. Females may be slightly 
longer in body. The withers are slightly elevated. The back and loin are strong but without prominent 
musculature. The back-line ascends slightly toward the croup which is just slightly higher than the 
withers. The croup is of medium length, wide and slightly sloping. Females normally have slightly wider 
croups. The loin is moderately short, muscular, and deep with moderate tuck-up. The ribs are well arched. 
The brisket extends to the elbow. The chest is broad and deep with well developed pectoral muscles. Ideally, 
the circumference of the deepest part of the chest should equal almost 1½ times the dog’s height at the 
withers.
<p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Shallow chest, croup and withers equal height, body too short, swayback, roach back.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Disqualification: Croup lower than withers.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Hindquarters
</h6>
<p>
The hindquarters are powerful and well-muscled. In profile, the croup is sloping. The angulation of the 
hindquarters is moderate. When the dog is standing, the rear pasterns are short, perpendicular to 
the ground. When viewed from the rear, the rear pasterns are parallel to one another.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Overangulation, sickle hocks, cow hocks.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Feet
</h6>
<p>
Feet are round, compact, and cat-like. The rear feet are slightly longer than the front. The pads are well 
developed, tight, black, and not splayed. The nails are a solid color such as white or black depending on 
the coat color of the toes.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fault: Splayed feet.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Tail
</h6>
<p>
The tail is a natural extension of the topline and set moderately high. It is thick and muscular at the base 
then tapers to a point. A tail of the correct length extends to the hock but never below. The tail carriage 
ranges from a pump handle tail when the dog is relaxed to a saber tail when the dog is alert.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Fine tail, curly or blunt tail, low tail set.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Disqualification: Docked tail.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Coat
</h6>
<p>
The Presa has a short, flat, single coat that is harsh in texture. It is very short and fine on the ears while 
slightly longer on the withers and the back of the rear hindquarters.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious faults: Satiny, fine coat.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Color
</h6>
<p>
The Presa can come in any shade of fawn, black, and brindle or any combination of these colors. Their face must 
have a black or dark brown mask that does not extend over the eyes, with or without a white blaze or patch on 
the head. Minimal white markings may appear anywhere between the chest and the throat or on the toes.
</p>
<p>
<em>Serious fault: Mask that extends over the eyes.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Disqualifications: Absence of dark mask, white markings covering more than 20% of the dog, coat color or pattern other than described above.</em>
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Size
</h6>
<p>
The desirable height at withers for a mature male is 23 - 26 inches. The desirable height at withers for a mature female is 22 - 25 inches. The minimum 
weight for a mature male and female is 100 pounds and 85 pounds, respestively.
</p>
 
<h6 class="style125 mt-2">
Gait
</h6>
<p>
When trotting, the Presa's stride is long, effortless, and well coordinated. During a trot, the tail is carried above the backline.
