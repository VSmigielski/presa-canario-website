I am not a new, YouTube dog trainer who puts an e-collar on a dog and when a dog almost kills him, he returns the dog back to the owner with the words "this dog is not trainable." I have over 30 years of experience training dogs. I can achieve anything I want with any dog. I combine old training methods with new methods, depending on the breed. I am not a show-off; you will not see many of my videos on YouTube.

I can definitely help you with your dog, no matter what the problem is.

What I don't do
- I don't train circus dogs
- I don't train with clickers, (you forget your clicker at home then what? Click with your mouth, click, click? Like an Idiot?)
- I don't train with electric collars—you can permanently damage your dog's brain
- No bull, just pure natural training the right way—your dog will understand

What additional training do I do?
- obedience, the complete course
- tracking
- train for Schutzhund title
- personal and advanced protection
