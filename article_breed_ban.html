                                    sorry that by your logic I could steal a car, run some people over
                                    with it and then you can blame the make of car for the accident, as I

                                    being born the breed they are. I'm sorry you cannot see the look of
                                    disappointment in their eyes as someone walks by their kennel, and
                                    refuses to consider adopting them based on an ill educated fear

                                    caregiver. I'm sorry that you don't take the constructive time to
                                    petition changes in the Canadian animal cruelty act, and in the
                                    criminal code that would deal out serious punishment to the real

                                    it is a pitbull. I'm sorry you feel the need to terrorize my family

                                    year. I'm sorry our media censors and refuses to print the breed

                                    morning to feel a warm pitbull cuddled next to you in bed, and know
                                    that you are their total world, and even if the house caught fire and
                                    trapped you, they would stay with you to the end.

                            I'm sorry you are frightened of my dogs and are trying to have them
                            killed because they are pitbulls.
                        </p>

                            I'm sorry you lack the understanding of this breed's true history,
                            gentleness with people, wonderful temperament, intelligence and
                            behavioral conformation. I'm sorry you won't read the ATTS stats
                            regarding our breed's true temperament, putting it in the top four
                            for temperament, scoring better than breeds like Golden Retrievers,
                            and cocker spaniels.
                        </p>

                            I'm sorry that you side with and protect animal abusers by marking
                            the breed of dog, and not the irresponsibility of the owner. I'm
                            sorry that by your logic I could steal a car, run some people over
                            with it and then you can blame the make of car for the accident, as I
                            walk free.

                            I'm sorry you generalize one breed of dog with one group of people.
                            I'm sorry you can't see the love and determination that many often
                            highly educated, non-criminal and "normal" types of people show
                            towards this breed and the great personal sacrifices that they make
                            to take care of their dog responsibly.

                            abandoned and abused pitbulls, dying only for the inane "crime" of
                            being born the breed they are. I'm sorry you cannot see the look of
                            disappointment in their eyes as someone walks by their kennel, and
                            refuses to consider adopting them based on an ill educated fear
                            mongering reporter. I'm sorry that you cannot be there when the
                            animal looks at a human for the last time, and in spite of betrayed
                            by all humans they have met, their tail still wags as someone
                            approaches with the syringe of Euthinol.

                            I'm sorry cannot be there when law enforcement shoots one of your
                            dogs dead inside it's own home in front of the children it mutually
                            loves for simply getting off the dog bed and walking over to say
                            hello with it's tail wagging. I'm sorry you cannot be there to rescue
                            pitbull puppies from a plastic bag in a dumpster, dumped there by
                            someone switching their illegal, and inhumane activities to another,
                            more lucrative breed.

                            human aggression, in the way that this breed can. Yes, I'm saying my
                            pitbull is smarter then you.
                        </p>

                            I'm sorry that the medieval witchhunting genetics of intolerance,
                            generalization, and racism make you feel the need to vilify a breed
                            of dog. I'm sorry that justice, equality, tolerance, common sense are
                            all things you hold dear as a fellow Canadian, and expect from
                            others, but do not yourself offer them towards a pitbull or its
                            caregiver. I'm sorry that you don't take the constructive time to
                            petition changes in the Canadian animal cruelty act, and in the
                            criminal code that would deal out serious punishment to the real
                            animal abusers.

                            I'm sorry you cannot see the disappointed look on a puppy's face when
                            the people petting it quickly frown, and walk away when you tell them
                            it is a pitbull. I'm sorry you feel the need to terrorize my family
                            and my dogs for crimes we never have and never will commit. I'm sorry
                            you don't have to live in fear of your dog's safety from hysterical,
                            and mentally unstable people trying to inflict all manner of evil
                            upon your dogs.

                            I'm sorry that you cannot see my breed working in some of the best
                            Search and Rescue groups in the world, saving countless lives each
                            year. I'm sorry our media censors and refuses to print the breed
                            name "pitbull' when in connection with a positive act such as saving
                            a person or child from a burning house, drowning, wild attacking
                            animals, etc. I'm sorry you cannot see the many pitbulls registered
                            as therapy dogs and bringing so much joy to another misunderstood,
                            neglected demographic in our society, the senior citizen.

                            I am sorry you can't see a pitbull kiss a child, step carefully over
                            a kitten, or play in a sunbeam. I'm sorry you cannot wake in the
                            morning to feel a warm pitbull cuddled next to you in bed, and know
                            that you are their total world, and even if the house caught fire and
                            trapped you, they would stay with you to the end.
                            But, now that I really think about it, I'm not at all sorry you don't
                            own a pitbull--you do not deserve one.
