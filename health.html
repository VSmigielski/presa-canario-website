                                        raw, you know that you are not poisoning your dog with toxic, saturated-desaturated fat, mercury, 
                                        and other poisons that you can find in every commercial dog food. Plus 40% of dog food contains 
                                        popular fillers such as sand, dirt, rocks, sawdust, and mud. Yeah, my dogs can eat dirt from my

                                    For safe feeding of chicken bones, the bones need to be processed in a grinder. We started with a small grinder, Maverick, 
                                    for $60 dollars and later upgraded to a commercial grinder, Vollrath.

                                    feed our dogs with because we purchase raw chicken from healthy stores like Sprouts, AJ's, Whole Food stores, or 
                                    directly from the farmers. We prepare our own dog food from human-grade, raw chicken meat, with no hormones, 
                                    antibiotics, and mainly...no garbage or toxins.

                                    When we bring the whole chicken home, we cut the fat out and leave it for the dog food manufacturers. In the 
                                    other words, we put it in the garbage can. Then, we cut the meat off the bones to make sure the bones will 
                                    fit in the grinder. Raw chicken bones are very beneficial for dogs but need to be processed in the grinder. 
                                    Never feed your dog with cooked bones of any kind. In addition to raw meat, we add cooked rice, cooked 
                                    potatoes, cooked pasta, and cooked beef livers and hearts. We make 1 lb packages of raw meat over the weekend 
                                    and put it in freezer, so we have it ready during the week.

                                    Before I discovered the truth about commercial dog food, I fed my dogs kibble as well. I tried 
                                    many brands: Canidae, Innova, Pinnacle, Origin, EVO and many other premium expensive dog food. 
                                    It worked for a month or two, but then it all ends up the same...huge, smelly, muddy diarrhea all 
                                    over. When I started to feed raw meat, I didn't have a single case of diarrhea ever. I saved 100s 
                                    of dollars for Metronidazole (pills to stop diarrhea) but mainly, I have healthier dogs. The poops 
                                    don't have that bad smell, actaully it smells like mushrooms in the forest. Not bad. Humans and 
                                    dogs live on enzymes and there are NO enzymes in commercial dog food. Ohhh..... they just realized 
                                    that and recently started putting some chemical enzymes in there but it's nothing compared to the 
                                    enzymes that you can find in raw meat and minerals in raw bones.

                                        It is simple. You should feed your dogs the same food that you would eat, only in raw form (just 
                                        don't feed spicy, salty and sweet food). Everything that is made for dogs is made out of garbage. 
                                        Avoid any products and any vitamins made for dogs, use the same vitamins that you would eat.

                                    to do that. Well, you should stop in a grocery store and purchase a sliced ham, mayonnaise, and bread to 
                                    make a sandwich or purchase grilled chicken (most grocery stores have it) and for your dog purchase raw

                                    . CaniSource dry dog food is so good that you can eat it as well. I am sure that there will be more companies 
                                    who will be producing quality human-grade dry dog food in the future. However, if you are on the road and

                            that they are selling at the store and your dog will be more likely to get sick. We have 100% control on what we 
                            feed our dogs with because we purchase raw chicken from healthy stores like Sprouts, AJ's, Whole Food stores, or 
                            directly from the farmers. We prepare our own dog food from human-grade, raw chicken meat, with no hormones, 
                            antibiotics, and mainly...no garbage or toxins.

                            When we bring the whole chicken home, we cut the fat out and leave it for the dog food manufacturers. In the 
                            other words, we put it in the garbage can. Then, we cut the meat off the bones to make sure the bones will 
                            fit in the grinder. Raw chicken bones are very beneficial for dogs but need to be processed in the grinder. 
                            Never feed your dog with cooked bones of any kind. In addition to raw meat, we add cooked rice, cooked 
                            potatoes, cooked pasta, and cooked beef livers and hearts. We make 1 lb packages of raw meat over the weekend 
                            and put it in freezer, so we have it ready during the week.

                            not healthy or are even poisonous for dogs and fish has too much mercury. 
                            It is much safer to use purified fish oil where mercury is removed.

                        </p>
                        <p class="style46 mb-0">
                            There are two reasons why your vet tells you this:
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46 mb-0">
                            a) He wants you to purchase a commercial dog food from his office because they get feedback 
                            from the manufacturers. It's all about the money.
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            b) Many vets are just like you. They trust these companies. They believe all the TV commercial 
                            bull and they feed their own dogs commercial garbage as well.
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            Before I discovered the truth about commercial dog food, I fed my dogs kibble as well. I tried 
                            many brands: Canidae, Innova, Pinnacle, Origin, EVO and many other premium expensive dog food. 
                            It worked for a month or two, but then it all ends up the same...huge, smelly, muddy diarrhea all 
                            over. When I started to feed raw meat, I didn't have a single case of diarrhea ever. I saved 100s 
                            of dollars for Metronidazole (pills to stop diarrhea) but mainly, I have healthier dogs. The poops 
                            don't have that bad smell, actaully it smells like mushrooms in the forest. Not bad. Humans and 
                            dogs live on enzymes and there are NO enzymes in commercial dog food. Ohhh..... they just realized 
                            that and recently started putting some chemical enzymes in there but it's nothing compared to the 
                            enzymes that you can find in raw meat and minerals in raw bones.

                            <strong>
                                It is simple. You should feed your dogs the same food that you would eat, only in raw form (just 
                                don't feed spicy, salty and sweet food). Everything that is made for dogs is made out of garbage. 
                                Avoid any products and any vitamins made for dogs, use the same vitamins that you would eat.

                            Kirkland Premium Performance Multi from Costco would be the best for your dog. 300 tablets for about $13 
                            dollars and you know that you give your dog the best. For smaller dogs you should cut the tablet in half, 
                            or give 1/3 of a tablet per day.

                            Now, what to do if you travel with your dog and you need to eat the fast food garbage? Sometimes we all need 
                            to do that. Well, you should stop in a grocery store and purchase a sliced ham, mayonnaise, and bread to 
                            make a sandwich or purchase grilled chicken (most grocery stores have it) and for your dog purchase raw 
                            chicken breasts.
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            However, if you don't have time and need to go to a drive-through to get your sandwich and you need food for 
                            your dog fast...then, there are only two companies that are selling human-grade dry dog food: 
                            <a href="https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/" target="_blank" class="view-links-1">Honest Kitchen</a> 
                            and 
                            <a href="https://www.canisource.com/accueil.php" target="_blank" class="view-links-1">CaniSource</a>
                            . CaniSource dry dog food is so good that you can eat it as well. I am sure that there will be more companies 
                            who will be producing quality human-grade dry dog food in the future. However, if you are on the road and 
                            purchase a cheeseburger for yourself, you can purchase 4-5 cheeseburgers for your dog, it will still be 
                            better and healthier for your dog than any commercial dog food.
