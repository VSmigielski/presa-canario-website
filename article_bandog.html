                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    Despite what some people may advertise, a Bandog is not a pure bred breed; it is a purpose 
                                    bred, mixed breed working dog. The concept of the Bandog, a cross between Bull breeds and 
                                    Mastiffs, is not a new. These types of dogs have been hunting boar, guarding homes, and 
                                    being used as police and security dogs for thousands of years. Many breeds such as the 
                                    Bullmastiff, Dogue De Bordeaux, and the Boerboel have been developed from careful selection
                                    of Bandog types.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    Earliest written mention of them is from tribal Britain. They were big game hunters, 
                                    guardians of property, person and livestock, and dogs of war. These dogs probably looked 
                                    much like a lot of the heavier types of pig dogs being used in Australia today.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    During the middle ages, Bandogs were used throughout Europe for their original purposes and 
                                    also became participants in blood sports and were baited against man and beast. In England 
                                    during this period the Bandog was solely owned by Nobleman. It was illegal for lower class 
                                    people to own dogs of this type, an offense which was punishable by death. It was feared 
                                    they would be able to successfully poach the Kings beasts should they have one.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    The greatest influence to Bandog breeding came during the 1800's in the way of the 
                                    Gamekeepers Night Dog, from which the Bull Mastiff breed emerged. These dogs were used to 
                                    catch poachers and were powerful and agile. I think they are best described by W. Burton of 
                                    Thorneywood Kennels:
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    <em>
                                        "The typical Thornywood night dog should be no less than 80 lbs and if it be 100 lbs and 
                                        fit and agile, all the better. It should be dark with a clean close coat with little in 
                                        the way of markings for easy concealment at night. It should fear no man or group of men, 
                                        no matter how sinister their intention. It should be able to face whip cudgel and shotgun 
                                        with equal enthusiasm and show no shyness or fear of the aforementioned. Once engaged with 
                                        its tormentor it should grip like a vice and fight like a lion and never relinquish its 
                                        hold of its own accord, even if it comes to serious mischief and takes its death. In my 
                                        charge he should be obedient and faithful. In my home or in his kennel he should be quiet 
                                        and good tempered. There is no better or hardier dog than a good nightdog."
                                    </em>
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    It's interesting to note that they were once Police dogs par excellence. The National Bull and 
                                    Mastiff Police Registry was founded in 1926. The requirements for the registry were that dogs 
                                    must pass all phases of police training to be accepted. Here's an extract from a letter to the 
                                    club from Sgt. Cordy of the Walsingham Police Station:
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    <em>
                                        "I want no better dog than a good Bullmastiff for police work and I am ready to back it against 
                                        any breed. It may interest you to know that I have made an offer to one of my comrades who is 
                                        an Alsationist, to train a Bullmastiff along side an Alsation to track and be more steady on 
                                        the trail. The quarry will be a pretended fugitive and at the end of the trail the dog must 
                                        close and catch the fugitive. A Gamekeeper friend recommended this breed to me and told me I 
                                        would have no better breed. His words were true."
                                    </em>
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    Sadly, in modern times most people have heard of the Bandog and relate them to the dog fighter 
                                    John Swinford. Had he not had his name published in print he would have faded into obscurity, 
                                    just as his dogs did. It is commonly believed that a Neapolitan Mastiff cross Pit bull is a true 
                                    Swinford Bandog, however Dr. Swinford found the Neo to be lacking for his needs, and his best dog 
                                    Bantu was actually from an English Mastiff bitch by a Pit bull.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    A modern Bandog is only as good as its breeding. There are many different breeders with different 
                                    goals, using different foundation breeds, so if you are looking for one of these dogs, it's 
                                    important to find somebody who is breeding the type of dog you are looking for. It's also vital 
                                    not to confuse aggression with protective nature, they are very different qualities. Savage dogs 
                                    of any breed have no place in today's society.
                                </p>
                                <p class="style46">
                                    For me a good Bandog is very similar to the dogs Mr. Burton describes above. An athletic yet 
                                    powerful dog, capable of finding and catching pigs, obedient and faithful, laid back and problem 
                                    free around the house, good with children, stable in all situations yet protective of his home and 
                                    family when push comes to shove. Health is also very important, as although it's rare, these dogs 
                                    can unfortunately inherit genetic health problems such as hip and elbow problems, cherry eye and 
                                    immune system problems. They can also suffer from the heat a bit more than some other types and 
                                    like to be part of the family. Dog and animal aggression should not be a problem in these dogs, but 
                                    early and positive socialization is certainly necessary. Another draw back is they are late maturing 
                                    dogs and for many, the closer they get to adulthood before they are started, the better.

                        <p class="style46">
                            Despite what some people may advertise, a Bandog is not a pure bred breed; it is a purpose 
                            bred, mixed breed working dog. The concept of the Bandog, a cross between Bull breeds and 
                            Mastiffs, is not a new. These types of dogs have been hunting boar, guarding homes, and 
                            being used as police and security dogs for thousands of years. Many breeds such as the 
                            Bullmastiff, Dogue De Bordeaux, and the Boerboel have been developed from careful selection
                            of Bandog types.

                            Earliest written mention of them is from tribal Britain. They were big game hunters, 
                            guardians of property, person and livestock, and dogs of war. These dogs probably looked 
                            much like a lot of the heavier types of pig dogs being used in Australia today.
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            During the middle ages, Bandogs were used throughout Europe for their original purposes and 
                            also became participants in blood sports and were baited against man and beast. In England 
                            during this period the Bandog was solely owned by Nobleman. It was illegal for lower class 
                            people to own dogs of this type, an offense which was punishable by death. It was feared 
                            they would be able to successfully poach the Kings beasts should they have one.

                            The greatest influence to Bandog breeding came during the 1800's in the way of the 
                            Gamekeepers Night Dog, from which the Bull Mastiff breed emerged. These dogs were used to 
                            catch poachers and were powerful and agile. I think they are best described by W. Burton of 
                            Thorneywood Kennels:
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            <em>
                                "The typical Thornywood night dog should be no less than 80 lbs and if it be 100 lbs and 
                                fit and agile, all the better. It should be dark with a clean close coat with little in 
                                the way of markings for easy concealment at night. It should fear no man or group of men, 
                                no matter how sinister their intention. It should be able to face whip cudgel and shotgun 
                                with equal enthusiasm and show no shyness or fear of the aforementioned. Once engaged with 
                                its tormentor it should grip like a vice and fight like a lion and never relinquish its 
                                hold of its own accord, even if it comes to serious mischief and takes its death. In my 
                                charge he should be obedient and faithful. In my home or in his kennel he should be quiet 
                                and good tempered. There is no better or hardier dog than a good nightdog."

                            It's interesting to note that they were once Police dogs par excellence. The National Bull and 
                            Mastiff Police Registry was founded in 1926. The requirements for the registry were that dogs 
                            must pass all phases of police training to be accepted. Here's an extract from a letter to the 
                            club from Sgt. Cordy of the Walsingham Police Station:
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            <em>
                                "I want no better dog than a good Bullmastiff for police work and I am ready to back it against 
                                any breed. It may interest you to know that I have made an offer to one of my comrades who is 
                                an Alsationist, to train a Bullmastiff along side an Alsation to track and be more steady on 
                                the trail. The quarry will be a pretended fugitive and at the end of the trail the dog must 
                                close and catch the fugitive. A Gamekeeper friend recommended this breed to me and told me I 
                                would have no better breed. His words were true."

                            Sadly, in modern times most people have heard of the Bandog and relate them to the dog fighter 
                            John Swinford. Had he not had his name published in print he would have faded into obscurity, 
                            just as his dogs did. It is commonly believed that a Neapolitan Mastiff cross Pit bull is a true 
                            Swinford Bandog, however Dr. Swinford found the Neo to be lacking for his needs, and his best dog 
                            Bantu was actually from an English Mastiff bitch by a Pit bull.

                        <p class="style46">
                            A modern Bandog is only as good as its breeding. There are many different breeders with different 
                            goals, using different foundation breeds, so if you are looking for one of these dogs, it's 
                            important to find somebody who is breeding the type of dog you are looking for. It's also vital 
                            not to confuse aggression with protective nature, they are very different qualities. Savage dogs 
                            of any breed have no place in today's society.
                        </p>
                        <p class="style46">
                            For me a good Bandog is very similar to the dogs Mr. Burton describes above. An athletic yet 
                            powerful dog, capable of finding and catching pigs, obedient and faithful, laid back and problem 
                            free around the house, good with children, stable in all situations yet protective of his home and 
                            family when push comes to shove. Health is also very important, as although it's rare, these dogs 
                            can unfortunately inherit genetic health problems such as hip and elbow problems, cherry eye and 
                            immune system problems. They can also suffer from the heat a bit more than some other types and 
                            like to be part of the family. Dog and animal aggression should not be a problem in these dogs, but 
                            early and positive socialization is certainly necessary. Another draw back is they are late maturing 
                            dogs and for many, the closer they get to adulthood before they are started, the better.
